# and domain/entity shift one slot left, so a --scope filter silently returns
# the WRONG rows instead of erroring (measured: `--scope agent.tool` matched 0

# The project an event belongs to: a PJangler registry slug, resolved through
# project_dir_map (migrations 005/006), or NULL when nothing claims it.
#
# This replaced a basename fallback chain that reported worktrees, subdirectories
# and bare-repo suffixes as projects. It also replaced a SECOND, DIFFERENT
# implementation in summarize.py, which stripped `.git` where this one did not --
# so /events said `intelliforia.git` on the card while /events/<id>/summary said
# `intelliforia` for the same row, on 399 rows in 7 days.
#
# `data.project` is consulted, but only if it names a real registry project.
# Trusting it outright is what the obvious ladder would do, and it is wrong here:
# measured over the whole table, three of its five distinct values are entire
# JSON objects serialized as text ({"name": "James Brennan", "slug": ..., ...}),
# and its highest-volume plain string is `wax` (2,803 rows), which is not a
# registered project at all. Validating against the registry turns all of that
# into an honest NULL instead of a JSON blob rendered as a project name.
#
# `data.repo` / `data.slug` are the last two rungs and they are what make the PM
# lens reachable at all. Measured over 7 days, ZERO of the 1,100+
# repo.task.* / repo.decision.* / repo.board.* rows carry a working_directory --
# they come from the Plane webhook and from PM agents, neither of which has a
# filesystem -- so before these rungs existed, "pick a project, click PM"
# returned an empty feed, which is the single thing the feature is for. Those
# rows carry a repo NAME instead (`33god`, `bloodbank`), which is not always the
# slug (`project`, `bb`), so it is translated through project_alias (007).
#
# Cost: four correlated lookups, every one a primary-key probe rather than the
# prefix scan a naive version would do. Measured 3.5 ms for a 200-row page over
# the default window at two rungs (compare 141 s for a correlated
# longest-prefix subquery, which is exactly why prefix matching lives in the
# map instead of here); re-measured after adding the alias rungs below.

# Where an event came from -- the colour of its dot in the feed.
#
# Derived in SQL rather than in summarize.py because the feed CLICKS a dot to
# filter and the timeline strip needs `GROUP BY class`; a Python function that
# runs per row after the rows come back can serve neither. Measured on the live
# table: `GROUP BY class, minute` over the default 60-minute window costs 18 ms.
#
# Order is significant, and the first two branches are the interesting ones:
#
#  * `payload.agent_id` marks a SUBAGENT, and it is checked first because a
#    subagent's events are also agent-CLI events -- the later `agent_cli` branch
#    would swallow every one of them. Verified over the whole table: agent_id
#    NEVER equals session_id (0 of 22,284 `agent_type='default'` rows), so an
#    orchestrator's own events do not carry the key at all. That also settles
#    what `agent_type='default'` is: those rows carry `hook: SubagentStop` and
#    230 distinct agent_ids across 73 sessions, so it is an unnamed subagent,
#    not the orchestrator (CANDYS-50).
#
#  * A `hermes-agent:` producer prefix is a named PM/momo profile
#    (`hermes-agent:33god-pm`). Bare `hermes-agent` is the fleet agent doing
#    ordinary work and stays in `agent`; the colon is the whole distinction.
#
# The Plane webhook arrives through n8n but its provenance is the ticket board,
# so `actor.type = 'ticket_provider'` is checked before the n8n branch --
# otherwise every ticket event would read as generic workflow traffic.
#
# `starts_with()` rather than `LIKE 'x%'` throughout, deliberately. A literal
# `%` in a SQL string that psycopg2 later parameterizes has to be written `%%`,
# and this constant is embedded in queries that sometimes carry params and
# sometimes do not -- so the same text would need two different spellings to be
# correct. `starts_with()` has no escaping to get wrong.

# Tool calls are 95.9% of the trail -- 159,816 of 166,723 rows over 7 days. A
# feed that renders them one per row is a scroll bar, not a feed. With them
# hidden, every consecutive run of tool events between two orchestrator-level
# events becomes ONE fold row carrying the count, the top tools and the span.
#
# Server-side rather than in the browser because the boundary between runs
# depends on rows the browser may not have (it holds a page; a run can be
# longer), and because shipping 25x the bytes to throw them away is the thing
# the filter pushdown exists to avoid.
#
# Two invariants make it trustworthy:
#   * An ERROR terminates a run and gets its own row, so a fold can never hide
#     a failure. That is why a fold needs no error badge.
#   * The counts are exact. Sum of fold counts + plain rows == the unfiltered
#     row count for the same window. Rows are collapsed; nothing is sampled.

# noise, and hiding two rows behind a control that costs a click to open is a

    Exactly one thing is ever invented: a missing `from`. `to` is passed
    through untouched, because a floor is what makes a query cheap and a
    ceiling is not -- `?to=2026-01-01` with no floor is still a scan of every
    row before that date, which is the case this function exists to prevent.

    The invented floor is anchored to `to_time` when there is one, not to
    wall-clock now. A now-relative floor under `?to=2026-01-01` would describe
    a window that ends eight months before it starts, return nothing, and read
    as "no events" instead of "you asked for an empty range".

    An explicit `from` is never overridden -- naming a floor is a statement
    that you want that floor.

    Point lookups are exempt, and this is the part that is easy to get wrong.
    `correlationid` and a bare-UUID `q` both resolve through a btree index to a
    handful of rows, and they are how the UI answers its two most common
    questions: pasting an event or session id into the search box, and
    following a session drill-down. Windowing them would break "paste an id,
    find the event" for anything older than a day -- which, on an audit trail,
    is nearly everything.
