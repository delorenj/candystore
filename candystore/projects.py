"""Resolve event working directories to PJangler registry projects.

The trail records where an agent was working, not which project it was working
on. `data.project` is set on 0.17% of rows, so for everything else the project
has to be derived -- and the obvious derivation, the directory basename, is
wrong in ways that are easy to miss. Measured over 7 days it reports git
worktrees (`feat-cartesia-agents`), subdirectories (`.agents`, `dist`, `web`,
`mirror`) and bare-repo suffixes (`james-brennan.git`) as top-level projects.

The registry is the authority: `pjangler project list --json` knows each
project's slug, absolute repo path and board prefix. This module matches
directories against it, writes the answers to `project_dir_map`, and leaves
what it cannot resolve visibly unresolved.
